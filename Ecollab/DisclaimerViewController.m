It does not apply to other websites to which we may link. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want you to understand what information we collect about you, how we collect it, how that information is used, and how you can control our disclosure of it. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE APP SIGNIFIES YOUR ASSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE APP. PLEASE ALSO READ OUR TERMS OF USE PAGE, WHICH ESTABLISHES THE USE, DISCLAIMERS, AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY GOVERNING THE USE OF THE APP.\n\nInformation Collected\n\nWe collect two types of information from you: information that you voluntarily provide to us and information that is derived through automated tracking mechanisms.\n\nWe collect personally identifiable information when you choose to use certain features of the APP, including project tracking and other client support services. When you choose to use these additional features, we may require you to provide your “contact information” in addition to other personal information.\n\nHow We Use Your Information\n\nWe only use your personal information for the original purposes it was given, including the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy and the purposes you otherwise agreed (if any). Your personal information will not be used for other purposes, nor will it be disclosed, sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties without your prior approval, unless otherwise required at law. We reserve the right to contact you regarding matters relevant to the underlying service provided or the information collected.\n\nPlease note that personally identifiable information is used only to provide you with a more convenient online experience and to help us identify and provide information that may be of interest to you. We use your personally identifiable information to support and enhance your use of the APP and its features, including providing customer service and project tracking and other client support services.\n\nWe may permit certain trusted third parties to track usage and analyze data such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the request. This is collected in order to better understand our APP usage, and enhance the performance of services to maintain and operate the APP and certain features in the APP. We may use third parties to host the APP, operate various features available on the APP, send emails, analyze data and provide search results and links. In addition, we may also share your personally identifiable or other information with our affiliates for the purposes of improving our service quality.\n\nWe may transfer personally identifiable information as an asset in connection with a proposed or actual merger or sale (including any transfers made as part of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding) involving all or part of our business or as part of a corporate reorganization, stock sale or other change in control.\n\nWe may disclose contact information in special cases where we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our terms and conditions of use or may be causing injury or interference with our rights, property, our customers or anyone who could be harmed by such activities.\n\nYou will receive a prior notice when your personally identifiable information might be provided to any third party for any reason other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, and you will have the right to request that we not share such information and we will fully respect your decision.\n\nWe use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our APP and for business and administrative purposes.

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we maintain appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information and data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures we have implemented reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.\n\nAccessing and Updating Your Personal Information and Preferences\n\nWe provide mechanisms for updating and correcting your personal information for many of our services.\n\nDisclaimer to Security\n\nBY CONSENTING TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE APP AND HENCE THE PRIVACY POLICY, YOU CONSENT THAT NO DATA TRANSMISSION OVER THE INTERNET IS COMPLETELY SECURE.
